x go through each of the five inner points
x find the LOWEST (ly) and HIGHEST (hy) Y's (their indexes)
- both tracks start on hy and go counter-clockwise??
- when traversing a track
	- if next point.y > this point.y, draw on WH0/2
	- else, WH1/3
	- when this point.index == ly or hy, next point = the other one
