- info byte to start line data
	- length
	- Y direction
	- X direction

- convert line XY table to scanline-X-value table
	- Y direction positive?
		- start from START of line
	- else
		- start from END of line
	- for each pixel in line
		- x:16 = Y value * 2
		- X direction positive?
			- get FIRST X value with this Y value
		- else
			- get LAST X value with this Y value
		- store that X value at wh_table, x

-- OR --

- might be able to directly write to wh_table directly
- from the start of "bresenham", I can tell
	- X direction
	- Y direction

- to start, swap the two points, if necessary, so that it is going to the LEFT for the left side of the window.
	- is p1.x < p2.x?
		- swap p1 and p2
- every step
	- calculate the X,Y like normal
	- y:16 = Y
	- wh_table, y = X
	- for testing purposes, set wh_table+1, y to be X + 10?

TRANSFORMING & DRAWING STAR
- 
- while drawing each point in the star
	- check the next 2 points
		- are they both going
